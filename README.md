**How is Algorithmic Trading developed?**
Algorithmic trading is developed following a main three-step process:
1.- Come up with a trading idea
2.- Turn it into a strategy (systematic and repeatable)
3.- Transform it into an algorithm

**How is Algorithmic Trading developed?**
- Once the Algorithmic Trading program is created, the next step is **backtesting**
- It involves the use of historical price data to verify its viability
- If the algorithm gives us good results (Backtesting), we could have an advantage in the market
- Achieving a profitable automated trading strategy is not an easy job (but not impossible)
