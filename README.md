## Why Algorithmic Trading?

**What is Algorithmic Trading**
- It is a technique that a computer program uses to automate the process of buying and selling an asset, such as: stocks, options, futures, FX currency pairs, cryptocurrencies, and so on.
- It is also known as algo-trading, HFT, automated trading or black boxes. These terms often used interchangeably
- It's a code that follows a set of step-by-step operations that are executed automatically
- Operations are based on the rules that have been programmed in advance
- Use parameters such as: price, volume, time, financial data, indicators, among others

**How is Algorithmic Trading developed?**

  Algorithmic trading is developed following a main three-step process:
  
  1.- Come up with a trading idea
  
  2.- Turn it into a strategy (systematic and repeatable)
  
  3.- Transform it into an algorithm

**How is Algorithmic Trading developed?**
- Once the Algorithmic Trading program is created, the next step is **backtesting**
- It involves the use of historical price data to verify its viability
- If the algorithm gives us good results (Backtesting), we could have an advantage in the market
- Achieving a profitable automated trading strategy is not an easy job (but not impossible)

### Freqtrade and Algorithmic Trading

One of the big reasons to use a trading bot and Algorithmic Trading in general (especially in cryptocurrencies) is that it has multiple advantages compared to trading manually. Within the main advantages we have:
- Execution speed
- Accuracy
- Reduced costs
- Easy scalability
- Emotionless executions

One of the biggest advantages of Algorithmic Trading, and using the freqtarde bot, is the ability to remove human emotions from the markets, as the bot and its logic or algorithms are prepared beforehand and within a set of predefined criteria

Thus removing human errors related to emotions that lead to irrational decisions

The main emotions that lead to poor human decisions are fear, and greed
